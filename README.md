This showcases my data manipulation skills and analysis in Stata.

The data comes from a publicly available survey data (registration needed) conducted by Princeton University called the New Immigrant Survey (NIS). I used this data to answer the following question: Is there a difference between the monetary success of first-generation Asian and Hispanic immigrants to the United States? If so, why?

I learned Stata for this project. After selecting my topic with my advisor, I found the datasets, combined and chose the relevant data from thousands of data points and observations, manipulated the data for regressions, and analyzed the results.

Requisites:
Stata13

To run the code, the data files (.dta files) and the .do files should be placed in the same directory. First run the combined_adult.do file to combine the relevant datasets. Then run the regressions.do file to get the results.
